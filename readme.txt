== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I show my testimonials?  =

* Place the Arconix - Testimonials widget in the desired widget area
* Use the shortcode `[ac-testimonials]` on a post, page or other area
* Place `<?php echo do_shortcode( "[ac-testimonials]" ); ?>` in the desired page template

= Why is the plugin basically unstyled? =

With no 2 themes exactly alike, it's impossible to style a plugin that seamlessly integrates without issue. That's why I made the plugin flexible -- copy `includes/arconix-testimonials.css` to the root of your theme's folder and make your desired modifications. My plugin will automatically load that file instead.

= Is there any other documentation? =

* Visit the plugin's [Wiki Page](http://arcnx.co/atwiki) for all the plugin's documentation
